echo "How it works:"
echo "1. When you start a sales session, the system takes a snapshot of all product stock levels"
echo "2. During the session, all sales are tracked"
echo "3. When you end the session, another snapshot is taken"
echo "4. The system compares: Starting Stock - Sales = Expected Stock vs Actual Stock"
echo "5. Any discrepancies are highlighted for investigation"
echo ""
echo "This helps ensure inventory accuracy and detect issues like:"
echo "- Counting errors"
echo "- Theft or shrinkage"
echo "- Unreported restocks"
echo "- Data entry mistakes"
