### Common Issues

**Q: Why am I getting too many notifications?**
A: The system has built-in cooldowns. If you're still getting too many, you can disable specific alert types in settings.

**Q: Notifications stopped after restocking**
A: This is normal! The system automatically stops alerting once stock levels are adequate.

**Q: No notifications for new low stock items**
A: Check that "Low Stock Alerts" is enabled and the item's minimum stock is set properly.

**Q: Daily reminders not working**
A: Ensure "Daily Stock Reminders" is enabled and your phone allows scheduled notifications.
