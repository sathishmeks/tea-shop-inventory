# Sales Management with Edit Functionality and History Tracking

This implementation adds comprehensive sales management features to the Tea Shop inventory app, including the ability to edit completed sales and track all changes using a detailed audit trail.

## Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Sales Management
- **Edit Sales**: Modify completed sales including customer information, payment method, status, and sale items
- **Cancel Sales**: Cancel completed sales with reason tracking
- **Refund Sales**: Process sale refunds with audit logging
- **Sales History**: View complete audit trail for each sale

### 2. Sales History Tracking
All changes to sales are tracked in the `sales_history` table with the following information:
- **Change Type**: created, updated, cancelled, refunded
- **Field Changes**: Specific fields that were modified
- **Old/New Values**: Before and after values in JSON format
- **Reason**: User-provided reason for the change
- **Metadata**: Additional context (items count, timestamps, etc.)
- **User Tracking**: Who made the change and when

### 3. Database Schema

#### Sales History Table
```sql
create table public.sales_history (
    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
    sale_id uuid not null,
    change_type text not null,
    field_changed text null,
    old_value jsonb null,
    new_value jsonb null,
    reason text null,
    changed_by text not null,
    changed_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    metadata jsonb null,
    constraint sales_history_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint sales_history_sale_id_fkey foreign key (sale_id) references sales (id),
    constraint sales_history_change_type_check check (
        change_type = any (array['created'::text, 'updated'::text, 'cancelled'::text, 'refunded'::text])
    )

## Migration Notes

To enable these features in an existing installation:

1. Run the `create_sales_history_table.sql` script in Supabase
2. Update app constants to include `salesHistoryTable`
3. Import new entity and page files
4. Update sales page with new UI

The implementation is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing sales data.
