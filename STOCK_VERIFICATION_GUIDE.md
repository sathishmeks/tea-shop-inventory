# Stock Verification System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive stock verification functionality to the Tea Shop inventory management system. The feature automatically tracks inventory at session start and end, compares expected vs actual stock levels, and highlights discrepancies for investigation.

## Features Added

### 1. Stock Snapshot System
- **Session Start Snapshot**: Captures complete inventory state when a sales session begins
- **Session End Snapshot**: Records inventory levels when the session closes
- **Product-Level Tracking**: Individual quantities and values for every product
- **Automatic Creation**: Snapshots are created automatically during session management

### 2. Stock Verification Engine
- **Expected vs Actual Comparison**: Calculates expected stock (starting - sales) vs actual count
- **Variance Detection**: Identifies discrepancies with detailed analysis
- **Accuracy Percentage**: Overall session accuracy metrics
- **Discrepancy Categorization**: Classifies issues as excess, shortage, or accurate

### 3. Visual Verification Interface
- **Stock Verification Page**: Detailed product-by-product analysis
- **Summary Dashboard**: Overall accuracy and discrepancy counts
- **Color-Coded Results**: Visual indicators for accurate, excess, and shortage items
- **Session Completion Dialog**: Immediate feedback when ending sessions

## Database Schema

### Stock Snapshots Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_snapshots (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id UUID REFERENCES wallet_balances(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    snapshot_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (snapshot_type IN ('session_start', 'session_end')),
    snapshot_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    total_products_count INTEGER,
    total_stock_value DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Stock Snapshot Items Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_snapshot_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    snapshot_id UUID REFERENCES stock_snapshots(id),
    product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    unit VARCHAR(50),
    quantity_recorded DECIMAL(10,3),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_value DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Core Service
- **StockSnapshotService**: Manages snapshot creation and verification
- **Automated Integration**: Hooks into existing session start/end processes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if snapshot creation fails

### 2. Domain Entities
- **StockSnapshot**: Represents session inventory state
- **StockSnapshotItem**: Individual product quantities
- **StockVerificationResult**: Comparison and variance analysis

### 3. User Interface
- **Enhanced Session Dialogs**: Include stock verification status
- **Verification Page**: Detailed product-level analysis
- **Summary Cards**: Visual accuracy metrics

## Workflow

### Session Start Process
1. User initiates sales session with opening balance
2. System creates wallet_balance record
3. **NEW**: Automatic stock snapshot is created
4. All current product quantities and values are recorded
5. Session begins with baseline inventory state

### Session End Process
1. User ends session with closing balance
2. Cash reconciliation is performed
3. **NEW**: End session stock snapshot is created
4. **NEW**: Stock verification analysis runs automatically
5. **NEW**: Verification dialog shows cash + stock status
6. User can view detailed discrepancy report

### Verification Analysis
```
For each product:
- Starting Quantity (from start snapshot)
- Sales Quantity (from sale_items during session)
- Expected Quantity = Starting - Sales
- Actual Quantity (from end snapshot)
- Variance = Actual - Expected
- Status = Accurate | Excess | Shortage
```

## Benefits

### 1. Inventory Accuracy
- **Real-time Verification**: Immediate detection of stock discrepancies
- **Loss Prevention**: Early identification of theft or shrinkage
- **Error Detection**: Highlights counting or data entry mistakes

### 2. Operational Efficiency
- **Automated Process**: No manual stock counting required
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant verification results
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all stock movements

### 3. Business Intelligence
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Track inventory management performance
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical variance patterns
- **Staff Accountability**: User-specific verification results

## Usage Examples

### 1. Perfect Session (100% Accuracy)
```
✅ Session Complete
💰 Cash: Balances match perfectly! (Sales: ₹2,450.00)
📦 Stock: 15/15 products accurate (100.0%)
```

### 2. Session with Discrepancies
```
⚠️ Session Complete
💰 Cash: Extra cash: ₹50.00 (Sales: ₹2,450.00)
📦 Stock: 12/15 products accurate (80.0%)
🔍 3 discrepancies found - View Details
```

### 3. Detailed Product Analysis
```
Product: Green Tea Premium
Starting: 100.0 | Sold: 15.0 | Expected: 85.0 | Actual: 83.0
⚠️ Variance: -2.0 units (Stock Shortage)
💡 Possible counting error or unreported damage
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL script in Supabase:
```bash
./setup_stock_verification.sh
```

### 2. Code Integration
The following files have been added/modified:
- `lib/domain/entities/stock_snapshot.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/core/services/stock_snapshot_service.dart` (NEW)  
- `lib/presentation/pages/sales/stock_verification_page.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/presentation/pages/sales/sales_page.dart` (MODIFIED)
- `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` (MODIFIED)

### 3. Testing
1. Start a sales session
2. Make some sales
3. End the session
4. Verify the stock verification dialog appears
5. Click "View Details" to see the verification page

## Error Handling

### 1. Graceful Degradation
- If snapshot creation fails, session continues normally
- Warnings are logged but don't block operations
- Users see informative error messages

### 2. Data Validation
- Snapshots only created if products exist
- Verification requires both start and end snapshots
- Invalid data is handled with appropriate fallbacks

### 3. Network Resilience
- Offline mode continues to work normally
- Snapshots sync when connection restored
- Local inventory updates remain functional

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Analytics
- Variance trend analysis
- Staff performance metrics
- Product-specific accuracy tracking

### 2. Mobile Notifications
- Push alerts for significant discrepancies
- Daily accuracy summaries
- Automated reports to management

### 3. Integration Improvements
- Barcode scanning for verification
- Photo documentation of discrepancies
- Integration with security cameras

## Maintenance

### 1. Database Cleanup
Snapshots accumulate over time. Consider:
- Archiving old snapshots (>6 months)
- Aggregating historical data
- Implementing data retention policies

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor snapshot creation time
- Track verification query performance  
- Optimize for large product catalogs

### 3. Regular Audits
- Review verification accuracy trends
- Validate discrepancy categorization
- Update variance thresholds as needed

## Support
